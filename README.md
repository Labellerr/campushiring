# End-to-End Vehicle & Pedestrian Segmentation and Tracking

This repository contains the full solution for an end-to-end project focused on semantic segmentation and multi-object tracking of vehicles and pedestrians.

## Project Summary

- Collected diverse street images via the Unsplash API.  
- Annotated images with Labellerr using AI-assisted polygon masks for efficient labeling.  
- Fine-tuned a YOLO-Seg model for feature-rich segmentation.  
- Integrated ByteTrack for multi-object tracking across video frames.  
- Developed a Streamlit app for interactive video upload, tracking visualization, and artifact downloads.

## Features

- AI-assisted labeling to speed up annotation.  
- Real-time video object tracking with persistent identity assignment.  
- Export of both the tracked video (.mp4) and detailed JSON tracking results.  
- Modular codebase for training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
