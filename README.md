# Labellerr AI Software Engineer Assignment Submission

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Labellerr AI Software Engineer Internship assignment. The project demonstrates my skills in building an end-to-end image segmentation pipeline, as per the requirements outlined in the assignment brief.

## Features

- Image segmentation using state-of-the-art deep learning models
- Clean, modular codebase with clear documentation
- Easy-to-run scripts and reproducible results

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd campushiring
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(or use `npm install` if your project is in Node.js)*

3. **Run the main script**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
   *(or use the relevant command for your stack)*

## Folder Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the segmentation pipeline
- `models/` - Pretrained models and weights
- `data/` - Sample input images
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments and analysis
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Results

Sample segmentation outputs are provided in the `results/` folder. Detailed explanations and visualizations can be found in the included Jupyter notebook.
