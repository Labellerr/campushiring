# Vehicle & Pedestrian Segmentation & Tracking

This assignment demonstrates an end-to-end computer vision workflow for segmenting and tracking vehicles and pedestrians.  
It uses **Labellerr** for annotation, **YOLOv8-seg** for segmentation, and **ByteTrack** for tracking.  
The focus is on understanding the process rather than achieving high accuracy.
