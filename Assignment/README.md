# Labellerr Assignment

For this assignment, I worked with a small dataset of car and vehicle images collected from the internet.  
I organized the data into two sets: one for training (40 images) and another for testing (15 images).  

The images were annotated on the Labellerr platform, where I used the polygon tool along with the SAM-based AI assistance to outline the vehicles.  

After completing the annotations, the labeled dataset was used to train a basic detection model that can identify cars in input images.
